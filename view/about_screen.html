        <a>This site was created as a project for WAP. Its functionality is to upload, store and manage files on a server. For our backend we use <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> api.
           The file storage is managed by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> using <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html">Mongoose</a> library. Files are stored localy on the server with metadata stored in mongodb for easy management.
           Files are also periodicaly cheked and old files are deleted from the server. 
           <br>
           <br>
           You can upload you file by clicking on upload section in navigation bar or just bu clicking on the logo.
           After upload, server will generate two unique links. Its up to you as a user to store them or distribute them as you need. 
           <br>
           Firt (download) link will enable you to download the uploaded file. 
           <br>
           Second (manage) link will open up a manage screen where you can: delete file, generate new link, check download count or redownload the file.
           <br>
           <br>
